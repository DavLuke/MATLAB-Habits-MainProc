% Set the color of our dot to full red. Color is defined by red green
% and blue components (RGB). So we have three numbers which
% define our RGB values. The maximum number for each is 1 and the minimum
% 0. So, "full red" is [1 0 0]. "Full green" [0 1 0] and "full blue" [0 0
% 1]. Play around with these numbers and see the result.

% Draw the dot to the screen. For information on the command used in
% this line type "Screen DrawDots?" at the command line (without the
% brackets) and press enter. Here we used good antialiasing to get nice
% smooth edges
